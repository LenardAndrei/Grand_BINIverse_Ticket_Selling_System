# Grand_BINIverse_Ticket_Selling_System

Brief Introduction

	The Grand BINIverse Ticket-Selling System is a Java-based application designed to streamline ticket sales for the Grand BINIverse, a 3-day concert event offering six ticket categories: VIP, Patron A, Patron B, Lower Box, Upper Box, and General Admission. Customers enter their name, email, and preferred payment method, select a concert day, and choose from available seats. Each transaction allows up to four tickets, with each email restricted to a single transaction for one concert day. Upon completion, an e-ticket is generated and sent via email, supporting SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production. Moreover, 10% of the ticket price is donated to a customer-selected charity, promoting social responsibility.
